## Gamepad support

The game supports PS5 DualSense, Xbox, Nintendo Switch Pro and most
generic controllers. If a controller exposes the Gamepad API "standard"
mapping it is used automatically. For others a default layout is
provided and can be adjusted.

### Remapping buttons

Use the **Controller Mapping** panel displayed in game. Click "Set"
next to an action then press the desired button on your controller.
The chosen mapping is stored in your browser's `localStorage` and is
reloaded on subsequent sessions.
